	<h1>Write a HTML program to create an ordered list explaining the code optimisation</h1><hr>
  <p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied</li>
		<li>We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase it's total run time</li>
		<li>We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms</li>
	</ol>
